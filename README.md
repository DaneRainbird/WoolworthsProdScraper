# Woolwroths Products Scraper
A super simple Python script designed to get a list of products (with some associated extra data, such as price and URL) from the Woolworths API. 

## Usage
Ensure that you have installed the Python `requests` module, and then run the script:

```python3 main.py```

Once finished, the script will create two files:
- `categories.json`: A JSON file containing the categories and their URLs
- `products.json`: A JSON file containing the products and their information
